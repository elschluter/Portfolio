### Education
Tufts University MS, MPH | GPA: 3.92 | Graduation: May 2024
- MS in Food and Nutrition Policy and Programs with a concentration in U.S. nutrition policies and programs, epidemiology and data analytics for nutriton, and research methods
- MPH with a concentration in epidemiology and biostatistics

#### Graduate Coursework and Projects
- Intermediate Biostatistics: Conducted a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES data to assess the association between food insecurity and depression in US adults using STATA.  
- Data Visualization and Effective Communication: Created infographics and used Excel to create an array of visuals with succinate descriptions to present the results of my research on food insecurity and depression. 
- Advanced Data Analysis: Analyzed trends in US food loss from 1970-2018 by food groups and supply chain level through linear, quadratic, and cubic regression in RStudio. Overall, forty best fit models were found to describe each stratification. Visualizations for the trends were created using the ggplot2 package.
- Fundamentals of GIS: Performed a risk analysis using ArcGIS Pro to identify counties in Wisconsin where well water is at a high risk for nitrogen contamination from agriculture practices. Presented the results through a poster created using Microsoft Publisher.
- Other relevant courses: Survey Research, Principles of Biostatistics, Data Wrangling, Intro to SAS, Principles of Epidemiology, Intermediate Epidemiology, Nutritional Epidemiology

St. Catherine University BS in Dietetics | GPA 3.97 | May 2021
Progam Experiences:
  - Senior Honors Project on the local food system in the Twin Cities (MN). Highlighted community organizations working to address food insecurity, health disparities, environmental racism, and food sovereignty in the food system. Interviewed relevant staff to produce a series of vignettes. Discussed what still needs to be addressed to create a sustainable and equitable food system locally and nationally.
  - Capstone Paper and Presentation on injustices associated with modern and conventional agricultural practices: Outlined how common agricultural practices impact the environment, biodiversity, animal health, and human health. Additionally, documented how those practices are interwoven with, and perpetuate, environmental, racial, and social injustices and the need for sustainable farming practices.
  - Co-author on a paper accepted for publication, titled “A Campus-Based Community Clinic and Food-Shelf Join Efforts to Reduce Food Insecurity Using a One Health Approach Toward Building a Vibrant Living System.” This paper was published in the Journal of American College Health. It describes how the One Health concept, which emphasizes the intersectionality of human, animal, and environmental health, is modeled on St. Kate’s campus.
